##Class Prep for January 23, 2019
I did not do any background searching before clicking the link to the reading "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" by Ted Chiang; I just started reading. In a way, this piece feels like a mix between the TV series *Lost* in that it constantly skips between timelines (I have not seen the show *Lost*, I just know that it does this) and also *Black Mirror* in that it is a somewhat foreboding prediction on what technology's impact can have on the future (in writing this, I think of how Jijingi had trouble understanding what words meant until he created a metaphor for it in a context that he was familiar with: bones under the skin (which is a metaphor that would probably not have helped those of us who did not have that familiarity with that trade) and that I naturally created a metaphor of this text to common TV shows in order to understand it better as well) (in addition, just to add on to last week's lab, I was initially taken aback when no red spell check squiggly came up when I typed the name Jijingi, but in a good way. I was ready for the computer system to alienate someone's name just because it was not "normal" just like my last name is often alienated by the red squiggly and I conclude that I actually like that markdown does not care for correcting "mispellings"). I took Remem to be a futuristic-metaphoric version of writing in that it can defy time, store information that would be lost to time, and can be referenced back to in the future if it needed to be, just like writing can. Similarily, I guess the account of the Tiv people is a paralelle to the Remem story, but set further back in time (I assume but to be quite honest it could be set today as well; I just attribute missionary times to be a thing of the past because that's the way we speak of it but it could very well be happening right now as well) to where written documents were introduced to a group of people. Both narratives border on the edge of the introduction of a new technology and question the pros and cons of it.

At this point in my life, where I am no longer a kid yet beginning to just be a full on (pokemon evolution level 3) adult (I am 22. Honestly what does that mean?) I am apprehensive every time I am faced with the fear of something new or the nostalgia of the past. Sure the new iPhone's are scary. No headphone jack? AirPods?? WhErE iS thE hoMe bUTton????? And sure thinking about portable CD players bring back warm memories. But I often forget that you also had to lug around giant thick CD cases and that the slightest bump on the player could trigger what feels like an earthquake on the high end of the Richter scale to your listening pleasure. Especially since I have grown up in a time where technology is rapidly changing (is it? Every generation seems to think their's is the most pivotal one to be quite honest), I cannot decipher what is new because it is so radically different than the old and what is new just because *I am old.* And I constantly wonder if my resistance to change is the early symptoms of me becoming a conservative (God I hope not) or perhaps it is a natural sign that humanity could slow down a few notches before we radically plummet into the unknown. Not to quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park but when will we ever ask *should we?* when introducing a new technology instead of *can we?* or am I just jealous of future generations having things I never will be able to enjoy in my youth and being nostalgically upset about the past that they will never get to experience?
