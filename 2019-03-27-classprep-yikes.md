## Class Prep 03.27.19
 
In "The End of Books" by Octave Uzzane, I appreciate the line "Since we are remodeling the future of society to suit ourselves..." because it certaintly did feel a bit like all hogwash, their predictions of the future. 

Blackcross' ideas about the future of art honestly did not feel too different from what they probably already thought art was: "A closed aristocracy." Art, as An Institution, is quite pretentious in that only a few people get to decide What Is Art And What Belongs In A Museum, excluding many artworks from people of color or other minorities or people who couldn't afford or risk an art education. People like Blackcross who claim that art isn't good anymore and that "everything is a copy of a copy" just aren't looking around for art hard enough. They're just looking at one place for art and that's why they think that.

James Whittemore's predictions of the future of the continents were also not so different from how the western view of the continents already existed in that Africa is seen as a prize, a battleground, and a storehouse of goodies that the rest of continents feel entitled to take from.

Julius Pollock's ideas about the future of food is not as morally problematic but I mean I still think people are going to want to eat for taste reasons and recreational reasons and social bonding, despite the fact that they wouldn't have to eat for survival anymore. I mean we do that now. I don't eat flamin' hot cheetos for my daily supply of vitamins and minerals. It's just for fun. Also I don't think we'll become a world of peace and mutual respect just because of the food thing. First of all, millions of people are out of jobs if this change happens. The food industry (although problematic in that they abuse workers with low wages and no benefits and are also destroying the enviornment)(there's more plastic in the ocean than just straws) is built up of millions of workers. In this future, if it doesn't exist, what happens to those workers? Not peace for sure. But at least we will have peace with the cows now. (that part reminds me of the part in the show *Community* where Britta is like "I can excuse racism but I will NOT stand for animal cruelty!" and everyone's like wait, you can excuse racism...?)

All in all, a bunch of high class "intellectual" males deciding the future isn't too breakthrough.

(this was just the early part of the story but I had a lot to say about it apparently oops)
