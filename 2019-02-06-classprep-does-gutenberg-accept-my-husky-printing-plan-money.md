## Class response 02.06.19

A lot goes into printing a book back in the day but I guess I never really thought about just how much work goes into making the actual printing press as well. Just as in the Stephen Fry video, one must be (or hire) an engineer and woodworker as well as book maker in order to make and use a printing press. I also found it really interesting in the second chapter of Amaranth Borsuk's *The Book* when she wrote that "Much as we laud Gutenberg, he was not in fact, the first person to use movable type." (73) (of course any time a rich white man says he is the first to do anything, be skeptical) It makes me think about how even though Writing Is Not Natural, many people around the world were all creating their own version of a printing press around the same time as if the printing press was naturally agreed upon to be the next big thing in book making. Also again, the concept of resources comes up too. The paper and ink in China was different than that of Europe and yet both places used and had to create their own alternatives to make their printing presses with whatever resources they had availble. I think it's pretty neat and perhaps even inspiring at how much innovation and creativity had to go into the printing press and book making in general in order to overcome whatever challenges came up.
