##Class Prep 2
Because I learned so much in this one chapter of The Book by Amaranth Borsuk, I also have MANY QUESTIONS. Perhaps for this entry, I will just put all my questions here relating to the parts of the text where these questions came up.

In the preface, Borsuk writes "We are not reading less, just differently... It seems only natural that the book should change with us." In this statement I wonder to what extent can it be argued that a cellphone itself is a book. Later on, her definition of book, supplied by Jessica Brantley is "The book may be best understood as the material support for inscribed language." I think this further adds to the case that a phone could be the modern day book.

Just as the poor were at a diadvantage from a literacy point due to the fact that the materials needed for writing were extremely expensive therefore inaccessible to them, to what extent can it be argued that those born in enviornments that did not even have the materials used to make paper or parchment such as bamboo or papyrus were disadvantaged by nature? For example, deserts, which could not support that sort of plant life or islands that could not cultivate larger livestock for animal skin or have too much of a humid environment to make the paper possible. Can we blame nature for holding back the progress of literacy in these places? Or should these groups of people have been expected to find other ways to have some sort of written or material form of language such as the Peruvian/Incans who used quipu/knots to "write"?

Before the alphabet was established, how was oral language standardized? I am thinking of this because of a Vine I saw on the internet of a man reading his writing from when he was five and it read "I had a grat time when I was chickkret" which makes no sense but what he had meant to write was "I had a great time when I was trick or treating." The reason why his five year old self mispelled so much was because the only was children can obtain langauge at that age is just by hearing and imitating. When we have written language via the alphabet which dictates what exact sounds and pronounciations we are supposed to make, we standardize language. However, before that, were we all like five year olds, just trying to imitate others and never really being sure or exact on the pronounciation of words?

When paper was expensive, I can guess literacy was not as important for every one to have since the opportunity one would have with a written piece was fairly limited. Therefore only a few were able to read and perhaps were expected to read aloud to those who couldn't, creating some sense of community or dependency? How has human relationships changed since then with the rise in accessibility to written material therefore rise in expectancy for one to read? Are people much more independent now then?

I never considered writing tools such as pens to also affect the history and progress of written material as I often focused more on what the words were written on instead of what the words were written with. In this chapter, it mentioned that the improvement of pens improved writing and the creation of written material as a whole. I do not know however, when the pencil or a tool such as a pencil that can be erased was invented, however I do wonder what the effects of it brought? Perhaps beforehand there was an idea about written material being permanent and also since paper was expensive, every stroke of a pen must be perfect and meticulously drawn. However, with a pencil or a tool that can be erased, did it change how writing was perceived?

Amaranth Borsuk writes that the scroll is not unlike today's way of reading on phones and computers in that it is a continuous, unbroken flow of reading as opposed to books which require page turning. I wonder if that is where the terms "scroll down" and "scroll up" come from when referring to reading on a digital device? In a way, is this a linguistic skeuomorph? Such as when we say "roll down the window" because back in the day, cars had to manually roll down windows even though nowadays it is done with the push of a button? Or is there another word for linguistic skeuomorph?

Early on in the chapter, Borsuk writes that we humans strayed away from drawings and adapted writing because drawings were not standardized and were too open for interpretation in order to clearly convey meaning. Later on in the history of the book, drawings probably took up too much space or time on expensive paper so it was also not feasible. In the times of early printing, drawings also had to be created through wood blocks or engraving so I could see why it also was not feasible. However, nowadays when it probably is not THAT much more expensive to print out drawings and illustrations in addition to text, why haven't we introduced pictures back into most books? We now just affiliate pictures in books to be for children or perhaps complex diagrams but I do not see why not they can be included in the every day novel now. Is it just because of tradition that we don't?

How does the direction in which we read shape our cognitive processes or even architectural structures? I question this because of the film Arrival starring Amy Adams wherein aliens come and try to communicate with humans. Adams is a linguist in this film and must decod the alien written language which takes the form of circles instead of a linear patter like English does. In finally understanding the alien language, Adams also received a newfound understanding of the time as well in that it is only linear due to our perspective of it. In addition, there is also a book called Transit Maps of The World wherein it is a compilation of the public transportation maps in urban areas from all over. Many of the western and US subway maps seem very linear as opposed Asian and Russian maps which are more circular. I wonder if transit maps and perhaps architectural structures can also be read as a language. If so, how does the shape and order of our language affect our perception of the world, cognitive processes, and even ideas of hierarchy and linear concepts versus cyclical concepts?
