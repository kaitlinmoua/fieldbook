In thinking about how the telegram resulted in changes in other fields, directly or indirectly, I think about how today's technological inventions are also changed. With the telegram, buisiness and finance changed because trends in buisiness could be communicated to other towns in real time, changing the market from being based on vague predictions and probably guess to knowing what is trending in bigger cities and adapting to those demands in time for those trends to meet your town. The way weather could be predicted was changed too, since the town over could communicate  what conditions they were facing that would probably carry over to the towns around them. Gleick does not seem to mention this but undoubtedly, war was probably changed as well. Commands could be given out from all places. Battlefields and strategies could be connected and unified as well. With every new technology, a multitude of applications and opportunities also are introduced.

In addition, I wonder how much the design of a technological invention is often based off of the human body itself. No innovation is really original is it? Everything is abstractly inspired from something previously existing whether we are aware of it or not. In that sense, we can never really imagine a new color or draw a new creature without it just being a hybrid of what we already know to exist. I don't think that's an entirely bad thing, however I think it's pretty sucky and ignorant to say that what you've invented is entirely "brand new." I thought of this when Gleick says that the telegram system was thought to be "the nervous system of Britain" (146 in my ebook version) since it is an electric system that  conveys messages across distances in an instant. In relation to bianary code, I think another metaphor for how complex a computer program can be based off of just two options (0 or 1) is similar to how the human genome is just based off of combinations four nucleotides. Another example, less related is how camera lens dialate and constrict just like the human eyeball does.
