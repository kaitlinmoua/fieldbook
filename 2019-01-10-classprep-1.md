##Class Prep Entry 1

Immediately upon reading the title, I am intrigued by media being “An Extension of Man,” because I often wonder to what extent are humans cyborgs nowadays? With phones we can call each other, measure time, get immediate answers, track others’ locations. The only reason we are not cyborgs is that the phone is not physically attached to us, but if we have a phone with us at times, isn’t it basically a part of us? This thought came up later on again nearing the end where media was likened to another human sense and perhaps that is true. A human sense allows us to take in the world around us and that is exactly what media does. However, media can lie (fake news)(sadly) and because of that, is it a human sense? Or a distraction?

Later on in *Understanding Media*, I like how Shakespeare was brought up in that we usually think of Shakespeare belonging to rather primitive times (I mean they watched plays, c’mon now…). I think this inclusion is to show that media has always been around us and existed; we just do not recognize it as the media we often see today. In that way, it brings up the main topic of the medium being just as important (more important?) than the message it is sending. I think if something is foreign to us, or more distant from our normal every day lives, like plays, we focus more on the medium than the message. However if it is something we are used to in our every day lives, like a tweet, we focus more on the message and do not notice the medium. Kind of like that little story where the frog sees some fish and he's like "hey guys, how's the water today?" and the fish are like "what water?" We are so engrained in the ways we consume media that we don't even notice it anymore.
