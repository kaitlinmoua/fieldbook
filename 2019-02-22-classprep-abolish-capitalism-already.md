## Class Prep 02.22.19

Today's reading's on the Victoria Press illuminated how gendered workplaces used to be (still are but to a lesser extent I suppose) and how spaces were made by women for women. When I learn about science, another predominantly male field, it is very apparent that *who* does science determines what kind of science gets done and many studies on the human body were often completely male-centric, using male bodies as the standard. I think the same goes for literature as well. *Who* does the printing and publishing determines what gets printed and published. So, if it weren't for the Victoria press and women centered workshops, publications such as the *English Woman's Journal* would not exist. 

I think the readings also revealed a lot about how our capitalist society's ideas influences the workplace as well. Emily Faithfull's article "Women Compositors" states that men often argued that "the wages of men will be reduced by the introduction of women into the business." (38) This idea still exists today when thinking about how people often fear (irrationally and selfishly) that increase immigration will threaten their own jobs and this fear is used to justify keeping minorities and immigrants out of the workplace. Capitalist workplaces feed on the fears of its workers, that there is always a finite amount of resources and that everyone must compete for them in order to just get a living wage. This competition leads to violent discrimination and hatred and fear towards anyone that poses a threat to one's own financial status. Later on, Faithfull writes that popular belief asserted "key note to the employment of women is cheap labor." (39) This also rings true today for women still, along with other minorities. Though people may be doing the same work, one type of person's work (white males) is valued more, therefore they are paid more. It was common sense back in the day to women like Faithfull that people deserved equal wages and it is still common sense today, however, the wage inequality still exists.

On a lighter note though, I am happy that spaces like this existed for women to work collaboratively and publish works of their interests. Even though they were held under heavy scrutiny as if the male dominated printing world was just waiting for them to fall, these women and their printshops persevered which is quite inspiring. Also I really like the dog in the *Illustrated London News*. I'd like to believe if I lived in the days of the printing press, that would be the content I would publish.
