## Lab Report 9

For this lab, we used the rstudio to analyze texts in a rather different way than most of us (English majors at least) are used to. We usually think of analyzing texts as trying to find the author's purpose or finding rhetorical patterns and techniques used by the author to convey their meanings. We can even analyze multiple texts by comparing mulitple books by an author or across a genre or etc. Analyzing texts via computer was both similar and different. Though a lot of the things done in the rstudio may have been possible to do without the use of a computer, I certaintly would not want to go through the completed works of Jane Austen and find how many times she used the phrase "I do not know." Using a computer to analyze text however makes this process easier and faster, allowing for us to spend more time on the parts of text analysis that we actually want to spend time on, like comparing how many times prominent women authors used "I do not know" versus men authors and perhaps what that says about how some genders are more conditioned to question their own knowledge while others may be encouraged to feel confident in what they say, regardless of whether they are wrong or right. I'm not sure if a computer can do that part of the analysis, but if it were, I think I would still save that part for me because it sounds like a good brainstorm.

Anyways, in *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, Marian Evans' (aka "George") main concern of her text being analyzed (well, second to main concern. I think her main concern was still people seeing through her "George" penname...) was that once it was analyzed, the original document would cease to exist. One of the very first things she says once her manuscript disappears is "Can it be undone?" (Padua 116)

In the days of manuscripts, that may have been true, since usually only one copy would exist. In a similar sense, people who only use Microsoft Word to type up papers might also be seriously risking it. If their laptop breaks, there goes their only copy. That's why I tend to use Google Drive just in case my laptop fails me or I forget it at home, I can still access my documents from a school computer or from my phone. Marian on the other hand, did not have this. In Padua's interpretation of the Difference Engine, it did quite literally tear up the document which was pretty sad to be quite honest. I suppose then, to answer her question, no, it cannot be undone.

However, in our lab, after analyzing Jane Austen's works and searching for phrases and making graphs and charts off her writings, the original source, Gutenberg, still existed untouched by our analysis. Because of this, we can still go back and enjoy *Pride and Prejudice* or perhaps even use it again to analyze it for a different project.

As helpful as the rstudio was (and it was indeed quite helpful)(how many words did it scan in just a blink of a second ??? I could never !!!) (though I certaintly wish I could.) I still feel that there is space for us humans. Unlike other examples where the introduction of a new technology replaced humans or made certain jobs obsolete such as Carl Schlesinger and David Loeb Weiss' “Farewell etaoin shrdlu,” I think here technology is an aid to humans as opposed to a threat. It makes research easier however, I, the researcher must still exist to ask the questions that research sets out to answer. Asking research questions involve creativity and also having a heart. I *care* about what these texts say and how it has impacted humanity and what we can learn from them. I can use this technology to compare how men and women were raised to learn and taught to talk about their own ideas and feelings. I can use this technology to analyze how often the singular "they" was used before the 2000's and prove everyone wrong that it is not some new millenial sensitive baby fantasy terminology. And even if it is, HI. LANGUAGE CHANGES TO SUIT OUR NEEDS AND LIFESTYLES. And I can use this technology to argue that last statement too! A computer cannot do that. But it certaintly can help me.
