## Class Prep 04.10.19

I'm always a bit wary of dystopian novels or novels set in the future that seem to set aside issues of race or gender, take place in an unnamed (but definitely western) location, and assume that in the future all social issues besides The One The Book Seeks To Critique are all easy peasy and peaced out not because the author predicts the future will be that way but instead because the author doesn't want to deal with the reality and dynamics of human struggle and only wants to write about human struggle in the One Dimension They Chose To Write About.

Overall, so far I like *Station Eleven* however. There are some aspect like character's names being ethnically ambiguous like Jeevan and Hua and Sayid that give off the effect that everyone is treated equally in the future based off their racial backgrounds but Station Eleven does have grounds in reality like the initial setting being Canada (Toronto I believe?). There's less of a cop-out setting of "This book takes place in no where, but SOME issues this world faces are still the same as our reality! Just not all of them because I can't be bothered to do research and write about it!" You can critique a thing whilst still being a part of and inside the thing; it doesn't have to take place in No Where. *Station Eleven* seems to do a bit less than that than other novels I've read.

I find it neat that even in a world without electricity and things all electricity allows though, some art forms still persist, such as plays and acoustic music. It's neat how the Symphony still can recreate *King Lear* and such even though it is no where near the production value (lights, fake snow, advertising, big agencies handling casting and stage production, etc). Does that make this sort of art more or less valuable? More or less intact to What It Is To Be Human? Who knows!

So far, I like this book though. I like a good apocalypse story. (preferrably zombie apocalpyse but plagues are cool too)
