## Lab Report
 Typing in markdown and using a GitHub repository is a little bit similar to what I've done in the Women Writer's Project wherein I transcribe and encode texts and commit them to the shared WWP repository. For WWP we also use Oxygen XML Editor which is not as nice looking as Macdown but a lot more complicated as needed for WWP.
 
 In writing and sharing this way, I think a big emphasis is placed on collaborative work. Even though I am using this particular repository on my own, I can imagine using this with a group just like WWP. This allows for writing to feel like a shared project that can be accessible by everyone in the collaborating group. It's sort of similar to in the past when I've had group projects and my group would open up a shared Google Doc and we would all contribute at the same time.
 
 Another difference is that writing feels like a continuous flow. I think of *italics* and **bold** now as something actually written, not just some sort of intagible essence that is added onto a word. Also by having these dual screens, it feels like I am looking at the "behind the scenes" version of my work as well as the "for audience viewing" version at the same time.
 
 In addition, that continuous flow feeling is also present in the fact that there are really no pages in this format. I don't know how much I've written as I'm used to quantifying my work by pages. This reminds me a bit of reading articles on mobile view on my phone. I really sort of lose sense of how long the article is compared to if I had the article in a book or printed on paper. In Markdown and on mobile view on phones, it feels more like an article is one long continouous piece and the only indicator of where I am is the little scoll marker on the side.
 
 A downfall to this I believe is lack of spell check. Maybe that will force me to pay more attention to errors though. If anything, that reminds me of manually writing, wherein I have to focus on how I write, in addition to what I am writing.
