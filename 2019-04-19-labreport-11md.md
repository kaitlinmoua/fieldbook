## Lab Report 11

In this lab, we made paper circuits! I felt very Thomas Edison-like as I ran lengths of copper tape across paper to connect LED lights to batteries and lit up the page. The parts we used for our circuits I assume were not that expensive as we were allowed to take them home, and I feel like I could find them again in a local hardware store or Home Depot. I fully acknowledge that systematic oppression and general deep seated evolutionary fear of the unknown holds back many of us from pursuing seemingly scary or daunting skills (to me at least at the beginning of this semester) such as coding or electric wiring or anything we aren't used to. However, it's also very hope-making (hopee-inspiring?) in that simple activities like this lab are also very much available and accessible to everyone as long as we choose to keep ourselves open minded and look around us.

I didn't have time to fully explore ideas physically out on paper but it did make me think of all possible ways this can be incorporated into book design. There's this $20,000 edition of Ray Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451* that comes with a match that can be lit by striking it on the spine of the book. Apparently the book is also fireproof (by it being coated in asbestos?). I thought it was such a creative (albiet dangerous and expensive) way to make a book that reflects its contents. If there's a book that corresponds to lightbulbs, I better patent this idea before anyone else does.

Also in thinking about all of our (many, many) conversations on "is this a book?" and "is this not a book?" I was wondering where on the spectrum between **book** and **not book** my lightbulb paper fell on. How many lights can I attatch to this sheet of paper until it becomes a *screen*? If I shape the lights into words and images, and get smaller and smaller LED lights until they are the size of pixels and then cover up the whole page with it until the entire surface is light in the pattern of words and images, is that not a screen? I like how small ideas like lighting up one lightbulb grows and grows until it becomes something else and as a result, perhaps everything exists on a spectrum. I'd like to think so.
