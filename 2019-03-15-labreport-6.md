## Lab Report 6

In this lab, we looked at a range of newspapers from the 19th century. They were all very large with tiny font and rather yellowed over the years however, the contents of them varied greatly from town to town, city to city, and region to region. A newspaper I looked at briefly was from Washington DC and was very political throughout. The other one however (and I looked at it longer) had a wide variety of topics from poems to advertisements to local news.

Aesthetically, I think newspapers still look relatively the same. Although we don't use giant presses like they did in the 1800's anymore, newspapers still are printed on giant folded pieces of paper and still try to compress a million tiny words onto one page. I also enjoyed the many uses of fonts as well, although it must have been a lot more difficult mixing fonts onto one newspaper in the 1800's and keeping them all sorted. In our own print piece, we had to use two fonts (since we ran out of e's) and that felt like a big decision to me at least, trying to find another font of the same size that would look good. It is definitely a lot more complicated than just changing fonts at the click of a button and not having to worry about the consequences of having to put a million tiny letters away afterwards. However, the fonts used in the newspaper then and today are still similar to me as well. In "How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think," Gayomali writes "Words hold power. But the aesthetic manner in which those words are presented can affect the way we read, and the way we think about the information presented." Words that were in bold and all capital letters certaintly caught my attention, and those usually were advertisements about huge sales going on, not unlike the ones we often see today. Words in tall, slim font came off to me as sleek and elegant, and those were advertisements for fancy goods and fancy clothes to give off an effect of being high end and rich. Those are still fonts today used by companies like Forever 21 and Milani and other places that sell things to make you "beautiful" and whatnot. Though the times have changed, I can see that some things like our feelings and reactions towards certain fonts still stay the same. 

The funniest thing I found in my 1876 newspaper was in a column of random quotes, jokes, and statements. It was just a simple statement that red *"vaccinate your children."* I guess it still rings true today and no one takes advice from the news. HAH! 

Aside from that I found the newspaper to be really interesting and perhaps more interesting at this time of history than today's newspaper. Of course today's newspaper is a bit more reliable, fact-checked, and written by researched journalists therefore it is more useful on a functional level. But the newspaper in the 1800's were more of a collective from the local towns, as stated in "Fugitive Verses," "the authors of a majority of nineteenth-century newspaper literature were anonymous." Many of the news, articles, and general content could be sent in by anyone so perhaps a lot of newspaper content was inaccurate but I don't think that means it was wholly unuseful. It's definitely entertaining, but more importantly, it was a form of connection and created a sense of community in a town perhaps. 

A danger to things not being very well regulated however comes with medical advertising. When I was still a pharmacy student (lol) I had to take a class on the history of the FDA and how it really had to crack down on the exact wording on medical advertisements. Before the FDA, any medication could boast about how it could "heal" and "cure" certain ailments and didn't have to state disclaimers and warnings about medical side effects at all. After a series of many, many tragedies, medical advertisements now have to go through a very complicated process of being reviewed before it can be seen by the public. Even today, I think only the USA and New Zealand have it legal for pharmaceutical companies to advertise to the public (and this is very much debated)(ask your doctor how Zoloft can help you). My particular newspaper in this lab was flooded with these advertisments. I wanted to look into the medications to be able to google if any of its components were now known to be poisonous but of course the ad wasn't required to disclose that information either. Perhaps I will never know if Dr. Swayne's Compound Syrup of Wild Cherry contains trace amounts of lead or arsenic.
