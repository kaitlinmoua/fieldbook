## Lab Report: Illuminating the Book

In this lab, we had to transcribe just as the scribes of the past did, by candlelight. Other factors that may have affected the scribing process like using ink and quills, sitting on uncomfortable chairs, not having central heating or air conditioning, not having advanced technology when it comes to making glasses or contacts (because I would be very blind without my glasses and Warby Parker was not around just yet..), or not having a fire safety person present, and a plethora of other things were not included but I am happy because dealing with writing by candlelight was difficult enough. 

In the Barrs room, it is pretty insulated so there was no draft that would shake the firelight as much but still, the slightest vibrations of our hands on the table would shake the light and disorient us a bit. My handwriting was difficult enough to read in the light so reading someone else's was even harder. My letter was written by Frederick Douglass I believe, who wrote in a very thin and slanted cursive. Though I found it hard to decode, I hadn't even seen Virginia Woolfe's which made me shudder. I feel like I had a slight advantage because I still like to journal so my hand does not cramp as much as someone who rarely writes with pen and paper anymore and the paper I write on often is lineless as well. However, with journaling, I am writing my own words and am devoted to my own wording enough to make my long winding sentences worth the effort. With scribing, I don't rememeber how many times I wish Douglass (great guy) would just trim down his sentences and use a lot less clauses and repeat words. I also work for the Women Writer's Project as I have mentioned before however that is a lot less painful since I can work from my own computer wherever I want to and typing is a lot faster for me. Also with WWP, it is on a laptop which I can adjust brightness with at the touch of a button and there is no (I hope) fire hazards that come with a MacBook. Editing my work is also easier since I can read from a screen nicely. Editing my own handwriting by firelight was difficult and even more, not very effective as I apparently left out entire words as time, which my classmate caught when he was reading mine.

Although light is easier to change and control nowadays, I still find it difficult when it comes to some tasks, especially watercolor painting which I sometimes like to do. When the sun goes down, sure I can turn on a light and still see but natural light vs the yellow light of my lamp or florescent lighting of a classroom is not the same and the light colors of watercolors often shift. I don't know if there is a perfect lightbulb out there that imitates natural lighting but I've yet to find it (or afford it probably). Even in our time, light technology is still trying to be improved. Some activities like writing aren't that light-specific, but watercoloring definitely is still.

Less of a hobby and more of just a daily thing, applying makeup also depends on a lot of factors besides the makeup itself. Again, light comes up, but also a main factor is humidity. I know to some, makeup can seem like a much more vapid topic but some people's entire career is being able to perfectly execute makeup and special effects for celebrities, photoshoots, art, and films and it is an incredibly intricate process. I am absolutely no expert at all but even the difference between applying makeup in humid summer weather (or when I am at home in Florida) versus in the dry cold weather in wintery Boston is hugely noticable. Makeup melts in heat. It rubs off easily and smudges. In the dry winter, makeup won't set into a face unless it is properly moisturized. I only have to worry about my face but when it come to makeup artists who work for other people, they also have to know how humidity affects other types of skin since some people are more sensitive to temperatures and they have to keep in mind whether or not they are doing makeup on a gusty sandy beach or in a fancy backstage room of a fashion show in Paris. Thankfully, there are developments and technologies in makeup that focus on being long lasting in certain humidities or on certain skin types like special blotting tissues, facial preparation masks, mists and primers. Also, over time, makeup and beauty communities have been discovering and sharing "beauty-hacks" and tricks to perfect their art. This goes to show that even though something on the surface may seem trivial or simple, it can actually be a very detailed, creative, complicated, and innovative art and that many factors change its execution and the work of its artists over time has found ways to overcome these challenges.
