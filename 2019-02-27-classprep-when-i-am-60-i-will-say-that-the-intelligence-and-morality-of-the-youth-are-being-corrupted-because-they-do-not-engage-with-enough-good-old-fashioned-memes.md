I think the sentiment that reading makes people *better people* has had an incredibly strong hold in the traditions of reading and it can very well be seen even in 19th century articles such as "On Novel Reading." The idea the the purpose of books and literature is linked to morality is prevalent in this article in the line "since youth must have something amusing and interesting, as well as instructive, what kind of reading will gratify these desires?" and its evaluation of the novel genre. 

In the Women Writers Project, a part of what I do is read reviews of writing done by women and tag them under different categories so they can be easily searched. Right now there about fifteen categories ranging from politics to review culture to religion and more. One of those fifteen topics is actually "morality," where reviewers of the 18th and 19th century often question what moral impact the works of women writers will have on its audiences. This intersection of books being held to a high moral standard in addition to the expectation for women to be the enforcers of morality and fairness (while men run amok because "it's in their nature) is incredibly peculiar (in that the more I think about it, the more I probably have to say (and complain) about it) yet not very surprising at all.

I had just finished (like basically finished yesterday) encoding an article review published 1793 of Charlotte Smith's novel *Old Manor House* that said "We now pauſe to aſk Mrs. Smith, or any novel writer or reader, what poſſible benefit can accrue to ſociety, and to youth in particular, from a peruſal of ſcenes ſo repugnant to decorum and virtue? To draw characters where the follies, the paſſions, and the vices of mankind are finally productive of calamity is proper painting; becauſe, from the ill ſucceſs and puniſhment of imprudence and criminality, an excellent moral is deduced." Clearly ideas about books teaching (or reducing) morality were serious and I'd like to say that they were posed even more harshly towards women writers.

In a similar vein, and as pointed out by Anna North in "When Novels Were Bad For You," the concern of *who* was affected by a novel's potential was just as prominent as who was writing the potentially morally misleading content. North writes "From the late 18th century through the middle of the 19th, she added, women “were considered to be in danger of not being able to differentiate between fiction and life.”" I can definitely also see this being a common belief of the time (and now) since women are seen to be so weak minded and easily confused and influenced.

However here comes the weird paradox of how women are supposedly smart enough to evilly manipulate others with their words and writing (therefore they should not publish) yet women are too stupid to tell what is real and what is fiction (therefore they should not read). *Perhaps patriarchial society will just find any excuse to keep women from accessing and spreading knowledge.* Mindblowing epiphany, I know. As depressing as this is, I think Jane Austen's method of ridiculing this idea through *Northanger Abbey* is an effective one and props to her.
