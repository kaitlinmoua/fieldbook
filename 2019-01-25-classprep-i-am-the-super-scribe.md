##Class Prep 01.25.19
Today's reading focused on how manuscripts were made and detailed in on the role and importance of scribes. While reading these texts, I'm thinking a lot about my job at the Women Writer's Project and how it might relate. Just as these scribes, I am also transcribing. However, I am using a computer and computer keys. Typing is definitely faster than writing, not to mention how difficult it would have been to write by candlelight in dark cold rooms in the dead of the night. However I am still trying to decode old texts that are at times difficult to read. I am still making decisions about how to transcribe an old text to something new while still trying to maintain the integrity and spirit of the original text so readers in the future can see it, and even though I am not physically writing the text, I still feel very closely connected to it, since I am going by line by line to transcribe. In a way, perhaps I am a scribe too. Just hopefully I don't mess up enough times that Sarah Connel my boss at the DSG doesn't send me hate poetry.
