## Class Prep 02.15.19

In Lindsay Lynch's "How I Came to Love the En Space," she writes "I learned how to make a book traveling from print shop to print shop across the country. I made paper by hand from recycled cotton tee shirts. I bound pages together and stitched intricate leather shells for them. I silk-screened, marbled, and block-printed paper. I sorted metal and wood type into words, composed pages, and ran them through countless presses." This again reestablishes that printing and book making was an art and skill all of its own as well, just as Stephen Fry's documentary and Benjamin Franklin's autobiography showed. Printing took the skills of woodworkers, metal smiths, engineers, and designers. Later on when she says that in printing, a space is not just an absence of a letter but actually its own physical block itself that had to be purposely put in. This made me think of the first lab when we learned how to write with Markdown and that making words into italics took a manual action and took up physical space as well with the asterisks. 

Syndey J. Shep's analysis of the emoticon was insightful and made a lot of sense to me when they attribute the revival of the emoticon in the net-age to how net interactions are so immediate. I know when I am texting a friend, I don't put too much effort into it and use shortcuts ("u" instead of "you", "lmao", "bc" instead of "because") and neglect grammar because I'm just trying to send a text as fast and clearly as possible. A simple ":)" is a lot easier than writing "Wow that makes me happy!" In ways, I think I actually find texting more convenient than actual talking on the phone and because of that, texting has become even more informal than a casual conversation. I freak out when I text someone and then they reply by actually calling me because the situation shifted to something formal and serious.

There's definitely a lot more conventions besides emoticons that I can think of now that I see on the internet that can't be translated into spoken word but still have distinct meaning. Like when I type like Jaden Smith and Capitalize Every First Letter Of Each Word In My Sentences it reads to me in a funny self important way now. Or often typing in all lowercase with no grammar reads to me as being lowkey and casual (that is how I often type outside of school and codeswitching back into writing essays is always fun)(what is punctuation lmao) I once saw a post on Tumblr that was like "asdfghjkl" means something totally different than "sjhdhksjhjksdhj" and honestly? I understood that after being subjected to seeing so many wild teen fans blogging and tweeting about things. (The first one is a bit more of a casual "I have no words!" and the second one is a more extreme tongue-tied exclamation more tied to frustration and flat out panic.)

"How typeface influences the way we think" lowkey blew my mind especially with the experiment with turning in papers with different fonts and getting different grades back. I definitely relate to this when opening a Google Doc and the default font is Arial which I cannot take seriously that I must change it to Times New Roman in order to situate my mind to serious mode before I start typing. Even in MacDown, the font in the black side of the screen makes me feel like I'm doing some serious high tech coding because it's similar to the font on the blue screen of death and on *The Matrix* even though I'm barely using the MacDown conventions most of the time.
