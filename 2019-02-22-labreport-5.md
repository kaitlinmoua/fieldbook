## Lab 5

For this lab, the quote we chose to use for our letter press job is from Fredrick Backman's *A Man Called Ove*. The quote reads:

**“She laughed and laughed and laughed until the vowels were rolling across the walls and floors, as if they meant to do away with the laws of time and space.”**

We chose this quote because it seems to describe actual letters such as vowels as physical objects that can roll across walls and floors. Though I am not sure if there is a way we can creatively show this, the quote does literally paralelle the lab in that the letters we use in the letter press are physical objects that we must assemble in order to create these lines and sentences.

Before we could start assembling the letters however, first we had to choose which font we wanted. We already had an idea about what font size we wanted. Since we wanted our text to be readable and also for our job picking letters to be easier, we chose font size 18 so the letters would be large enough for us to see but still small enough so we would not have to have so many lines in our quote. The font type was a bit more tricky. In Chris Gayolmali's article, "How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think," he cites typeface designer Cyrus Highsmith, "Typography is the detail and the presentation of a story. It represents the voice of an atmosphere, or historical setting of some kind. It can do a lot of things." I found this idea about fonts to be on my mind when we were pulling out shelves and inspecting the smallest details on the tiny metal blocks that would become the pieces to our quote. If we wanted our quote to be read the same way we envisioned it, we would have to pick a font that would accurately present the words aesthetically as well. When thinking about our text, it was not a silly quote that would need round or curvy letters, however it was also not a completely historical or serious one that would require something like Old English font either. In the end, we settled for a nice familiar middle ground, 18 pt Century Expanded.

Century Expanded seemed welcoming and friendly but also serious and "official" looking to us. 

Going through the fonts, another quote from the readings also passed through my mind which was "Letterpress has left its marks all over contemporary design," from "How I Came to Love the En Space," by Lindsay Lynch. She says this when she talks about modern technologies still using the ideas from the letterpress. For example, font flourishes that were once used to stabilize the letters when being pressed down still exist now, but more for aesthetic reasons. Another example would be the designing with a grid on the letter press but now the grid is on Adobe Suite. In a reverse way, I think it would be quite pleasant (perhaps a little cognitively dissonant as well) to see printblocks of modern day designs like an @ sign or in fonts that I'd consider new like Comic Sans. Perhaps I say this would cause a small amount of cognitive dissonance because my perception of time is used to keeping old things like the letterpress and Old English font in the past and keeping new things like wacky fonts and internet/computer symbols in the future. However, that doesn't neccessarily have to be. Though the letterpress is more a part of the past than it is a part of today's time, ideas from the past can still be transferred to today.
