##Class Response: Literacy

"As a morally good but undefined concept, literacy can serve as a cipher for the kind of knowledge a society values." This sentence of *Coding Literacy* isn't the first time I've come across the notion that literacy, whatever it really is, is associated with morality. I wonder why that is though, as many of the world's dictators have often been well-read and literate while still being generally awful (not all the world's dictators, but most.) I wonder how much of this belief is historically tied to classism and racism, guilting those who did not have access to learning how to read into feeling like a burden on society, therefore discouraging the idea that they could ever be a helpful part of society and justifying hatred towards those marginalized groups. Now if we think of literacy when it comes to coding, the cycle seems to continue as most computer science classes are mostly populated by white men, Perhaps it is not that literacy is important and moral therefore "the best" members of society become literate. Perhaps it is that whatever this predetermined group of "the best" people chose to invest their time in automatically gets deemed by society as moral and important instead.
