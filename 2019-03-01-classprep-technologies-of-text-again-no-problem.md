## Class Prep 03.01.19

The readings for today on memes and viral nineteenth century poetry really got me thinking about today's version of The Meme (i'm sure we all thought this since memes are all over the place now). To be quite honest, I never thought the word "meme" was even a word, much less a word with a definition that predates cat videos. I'm actually genuinely surprised that "meme" is an accurate word to decribe what I know of as memes today. In *The Information*, Gleick writes that "These are memes, living a life of their own, independent of any physical reality." This sentence reminds me of Plato's criticism of writing in that once writing is put out there, the writer can no longer speak for it and it has the potential to be taken in any way possible. In this way, memes also venture out from their origins and are taken up by all communities on the internet ranging from soccer moms to furries. Anyone can take the original meme and shift it to fit their own understandings and inside jokes. Just like the poem "The Children," the origin of memes are unclear though. At the time of its publishing, poems like "The Children" were published anonymously as seen by the quote “anonymity … was a fundamental characteristic of nineteenth-century American literary culture,” in "Fugitive Verses." It was just a part of the times that no one really thought of affiliating writing with ownership. I think that's how we think of viral internet memes today as well. No one looks at Pepe the Frog or Tuesday Again? Dog and think "...where did you come from..?"

Well, actually, I take that back. Every time I try to show my mom something funny from the internet she'll ask "Oh who is that, is that your friend?" or "Who took this picture?" and I'm just thinking like mom that's not the point, it's just a funny picture.
