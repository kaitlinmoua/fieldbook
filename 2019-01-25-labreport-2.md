##Lab Report 2: Into The Archive, Thinking With The Codex
In this lab, we examined two books from the archives side by side and then one more from an online viewing site. The books I chose to examine were *Japanese Tray Landscapes* (1937) by Alfred Koehn

*Between Page and Screen* (2012) by Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse,

and *Birds of America* (1838).

I think each codex on its own is unique. To start with *Japanese Tray Landscapes*, the paper is made from bamboo material sourced from China, similar to what was mentioned in Amaranth Borsuk's *The Book*. This book, being written by an American man (I had to google that)(it was a bit difficult finding anything on him besides the fact that he had a really big interest in Asian art and culture)(given that this book was published in 1937 on Japanese culture just a few years before the bombing of Pearl Harbor makes me wonder how this book was received during that era by American audiences) about Japanese art with materials based from China tells me that the world in this time was sharing (or stealing?) ideas and that global influences have taken hold in the art and literature world and very, very likely in the political world as well (imperialism!). Aesthetically, there are very few words in this book and I think it is to shift the reader's focus to the pictures in the book instead, as it is an Art Book. The particular page I have pictured in this lab has more words on it than the average page actually because I wanted to have more of the text just for examination purposes. The font in this book is different than the normal Times New Roman, possibly just for aesthetc flair or to look more *exotic* (thanks Koehn for not using Papyrus at least)(the font, not the material) but any case that means that the format and style text itself was being interpreted through art now too, not just out of convenience and neccessity. The amount of blank space on the pages and the fact that the pages are folded accordion style so that a lot of the usable surface area is actually within the fold, rendering it unusable, shows that paper decisions were not made out of *oh god paper is so hard to come by I must use every square inch to the max usage* mindsets. Instead, paper decisions can also be made through aesthetic reasoning as well.

*Between Page and Screen* I feel, is a book that tries to expand the boundaries of where we think codexes (codices?) end and digital screens begin to show that perhaps there is not a defined boundary but a creative and mutually connected overlap instead. Without the laptop, I would not be able to decode the codex. Without the codex, I would just be looking at a blank screen. Therefore I needed both. On the screen though, I saw more than what a codex would be capable of, like moving words and animation. It almost felt like a hologram except the hologram was on a screen instead of hovering over the codex. In thinking about what ways we can stretch our every day ideas about the codex, I think the most creative interpretations of the codex are actually in children's books. Sure, they are probably just trying to keep a child interested and entertained but I think it is still pretty impressive how children's books can have pop-up images (like a hologram basically but made from folded paper), multiple materials that you would not usually find in a book (I'm thinking of like board books with pictures of bunnies that have a piece of soft fabric where the bunny is so kids can touch and feel what a rabbit is like, or *The Rainbow Fish* by Marcus Pfister where shiny foil is incorporated into the images of the fish for decoration, not unlike the gold leaf embellishments used in medival manuscripts like the ones in the Getty Museum's video *Making Manuscripts*.), or folded pull out pages that extend from the page to reveal a panoramic picture (like Eric Carle's *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* or other books in the archives like the science ones that had complicated diagrams or geographical ones that included large maps). So are these ideas new or recycled? Why do the codexes meant for children perhaps more closely resemble the codexes from back in the day in the early stages of the codex than books meant for adults? Does creativity only belong in children's books and art books? I hope not. One of my favorite books, *Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close* by Jonathan Safran Foer also includes images, colored text, and plays with font size and spacing in a way that sets it apart from other novels and chapter books but in no way makes me feel childish or diminishes the content of the novel (which will make you cry ugly tears, it is very emotional). I think more books could be like that. 

Lastly, I chose *Birds of the America* because who does not like birds?? Also really because it is also an Art Book. Similarly to *Japanese Tray Landscapes* there is a central focus on the drawings so the words are minimal if not non existent. However, that is only at first glance because the viewing module actually has an audio player which gives you a description of the bird even though the words are not on the text, therefore one would have to use a computer in order to get the full experience of this book, just like *Between Book and Page*. I am also thinking in terms of accessibility. Blind people can also enjoy this book with the audio feature whereas in the very unlikely case that they were in the presence of this old book (published 1838) I doubt it is in Braille and if it were in Braille I do not know how much they would be abe to touch it since it is an old book and old books are Fragile.

Overall, though these codexes seem very different from each other, they all share one similar element and that is the idea that codexes can be vehicles for art. I just don't think enough books have pictures and I do not know why they don't but visual elements can be both informative and entertaining. I do not think a codex has to just be visually enjoyed as through these examples and the books that I brought up, a codex can also appeal to one's sense of touch and even audio as well. I have even seen scratch and sniff children's books. Taste we might have to get to later.... The codex over time has been influenced by many factors such as imperialist influences, global curiosity, environmental restrictions and enablements, and as seen through this lab, past versions of the codex. I do not believe the codex we have today neccessarily has to be the finished product as we might think it is and that it still has room to evolve.
