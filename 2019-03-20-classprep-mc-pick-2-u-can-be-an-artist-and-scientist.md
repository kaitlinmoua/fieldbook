## Class Prep 03.20.19

Wow I wish I could've used my weak woman body and mind as an excuse to not do math as that was the explanation for restricting Mary Somverville from studying mathematics. Just kidding. I like that I can choose to avoid math. That being said, I very much appreciate that both Ada Lovelace and Mary Somerville relentlessly persued their academic interests despite the restrictions placed on them. I'd also like to note that (although the dichotomy between arts and sciences is more socially constructed as hard bianaries than they actually are) Ada Lovelace was prevented from studying the arts and Mary Somerville was prevented from studying the sciences, and both of those fields are seen to be "opposites." Perhaps this just goes to show that the fields of study that are restricted from certain groups of people are in fact all just arbitrary restrictions that people hold from them willy nilly, and not for any rational or biological reason.

In terms of genre or presentation, I think Sydney Padua does a great job choosing the graphic novel to convey this story. In going back to that dichotomy of arts and sciences, Padua takes a very sciency-historical story and makes it an incredibly creative and visual (and humorous) graphic novel. I think this shows that no particular idea or concept truly "belongs" to one particular field. The computer sciences can be creative and artsy. Creative and artsy formats can be just as informative and "legitamite." As someone who really, really likes zines and art while still really liking history and science, it's heartwarming and inspiring to see that there are spaces that acknowledge the two can coexist and even create something bigger than the sum of its parts.
