##Lab Report 7

In this lab, we finished our piece of text and printed it! But not without trouble (of course). Unfortunately we ran out of e's. This vaguely reminded me of when you're playing Scrabble and you have the perfect word to place out but you are missing one damn vowel. However, we were able to find another font of the same size but it was in italics. Somehow though, I think it worked out. Our final quote read:

"She laughed and laughed and laughed until the vowels were rolling across the walls and floors, *as if they meant to do away with the laws of time and space.‚Äù*

If anything, it looked more poetic although it was not on purpose. I ended up liking it even better than how it would have looked without the italic letters.

Something like this would have probably never happened if we were simply just typing this out. The issue that occured with the e's would have never happened if we were just simply typing this. Microsoft word never says "ERROR. YOU HAVE EXCEEDED YOUR MAX LIMIT OF THE LETTER E." But this does happen with physical text where you have a finite number of pieces to work with. Again (sorry I cite this a lot but I'm *feeling it*) "How Typeface Influences The Way We Read and Think" reads true. There is a visual weight to all the words we see and how they are presented to us. I now read the quote that I've read dozens of times while assembling its letters differently *because* the words are italics. I can imagine David Attenborough reading this quote and once it gets to the italic part, he slows down as if to stress every word in a poetic and elegant fashion. 

However, even without the fancy italic part, I still think this quote is beautiful. As McLuhan says, "The Medium is the Message." In this case, a font represents a part of the message as well. However, I don't think that particularly means we should let it take total authority of the content. Now that I'm aware of how much an element such as font has on me, I think I should be extra vigilant on how it also can distort my perception of the meaning. What if we think the Declaration of Independence is a lot more amazing just because it's in fancy cursive writing, honestly? If the Communist Manifesto or Bible was published in Comic Sans, would it have that much of an impact? Who knows??? That's what's on my mind today!
