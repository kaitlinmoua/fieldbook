## Class Prep 03.15.19

Today's readings got me thinking about how much surface knowledge I know about the things I use daily. "The Route of a Text Message," for example, explains how a text message is transferred from our minds to our fingertips to our phones (I don't think the article ever specifically said smart phone/phone with touch screen which I find funny and assumptuous but I guess the data amount and overall process is still the same for phones with actual buttons?) to someone else's phone into their brain. I know text messages take up my monthly data usage some sort of way, but I never knew the exact amount. Definitely less than streaming a Netflix video but how much more or less, I never really thought about. I just keep texting until AT&T sends me warning texts about charging me $15 more dollars if I continue sending memes on the train.

I like that this article didn't separate the body from the technology and made it seem like it is one whole continuous process instead. The message does not stop at the receiving screen for it still needs to be processed and decoded by the human reader. "I love you," on the phone becomes "come wish me goodnight." It also just re-emphasizes that different people will decode things different ways just as probably different computers or computer programs will decode messages differently as well. For example, a bad habit I have when texting is when I reply "ok," I often type "kk" but sometimes I press too many times and type "kkk." My roommate knows what that means but a new friend was like "whoaaa man what?????" and I was confused for a second about what she was worried about and then I  remembered OH, kkk is an entirely different thing (actually the complete opposite lol) than OKAY. 

Also reading all of this is similar to reading about science because well it is science-y, but it feels a lot different from biology textbooks or chemistry textbooks in that we aren't observing and then discovering and then analyzing THE THING and trying to find out why THE THING is the way it is whether it be a result of coincidence or evolutionary processes or God or what have you. THE THING in this case being studied is created BY humans. Every reason why THE THING is the way it is was decided by humans. The things I take for granted was meticulously studied and experimented with via human decisions and trial and error before it got into my hands.
